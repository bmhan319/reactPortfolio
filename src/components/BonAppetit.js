While the build of this site seemed pretty straight forward on the homepage, the article page had some things that I had not done and was interested in trying to tackle.  There was a hidden popup menu bar that came up on scroll as well the effects of the hamburger menu when upon expanding.  But it was the Healthyish page that really caught my eye.  I was really curious on how to create a 2-column carousel that wrapped back to the beginning and thought it would be something that would be a challenge to myself.",
